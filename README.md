### This is the Computer History and Simulation Group Homepage

This organization is a site for those interested in Computer History and the Computer Simulators that run legacy operating systems.

The goals are to: 

  -  Maintain and develop Open Source Simulators based on the **MIT License**

  -  Publish approved Releases of Simulators  (Preferably using an Long-term-Support, Interim and Development versions)

  -  Make this a site that will appeal to a range of people; from experts that have seen it all, to the novice who wants to know what Legacy systems were all about

  -  Utilize discussions and the Wiki to discuss our projects and to provide **documentation**

  -  Run this site as an Organization.  



  This is a work in progress...

  I am not a coder guru that can build this on my own.  But I am really good at collaboration, organization and documentation.
  I can read most code and tell you what it does and do debugging and testing, but I've been away from writing system code for a while now.
  We will need to have members contribute their expertise, and it will be appreciated.

  Hope that you find this site useful.
